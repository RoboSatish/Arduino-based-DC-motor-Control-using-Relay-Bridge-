# Arduino-based-DC-motor-Control-using-Relay-Bridge

Relay H Bridge Driver Circuit, Simulation, and Arduino Programming, to design and make own Relay H Bridge to control a DC Motor. Need the circuit diagram and programming. 

# What is any H-Bridge?
The H-Bridge is basically an electronic circuit that is used to change the polarity of the voltage applied to the load. H-bridges are most commonly used in robotics for the Forward, Left, Right, and Reverse Movement. H bridges are also used in industries to Allow High Ampere DC Motors to run Forward and backward.
